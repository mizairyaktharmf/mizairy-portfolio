## 📈 To Improve Your ATS Score to 90%+

### 1. **Add Missing Keywords** (Most Important)

#### Testing & Quality Assurance
- Add: "Unit Testing", "Integration Testing", "Jest", "Mocha", or "Testing Library"
- Where: In Skills section or project descriptions

#### State Management
- Add: "Redux" or "Zustand" (even if basic knowledge)
- Where: Frontend Skills section

#### Agile Methodology
- Add: "Agile", "Scrum", or "Kanban"
- Where: Soft Skills or work experience descriptions

#### API Technologies
- Add: "GraphQL" (if you know it, even basics)
- Where: Backend Skills section

#### Cloud Platforms
- Expand: "AWS" → "AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda)" or "Amazon Web Services"
- Add: "Cloud Deployment", "Serverless"

#### TypeScript
- Emphasize more: Add "TypeScript" to more project descriptions
- Currently mentioned but could be more prominent

### 2. **Quantify Your Achievements**

Instead of just describing what you did, add metrics:

#### Current:
> "Worked on website maintenance, front-end fixes, system troubleshooting"

#### Better:
> "Reduced page load time by 40% through performance optimization and resolved 50+ technical issues monthly"

#### Current:
> "Built monorepo architecture projects with React Native"

#### Better:
> "Built 3 monorepo architecture projects with React Native, reducing codebase duplication by 60%"

#### Examples to Add:
- "Improved website performance by X%"
- "Reduced load time from X to Y seconds"
- "Built X features used by Y users"
- "Delivered X projects on time and within budget"
- "Increased user engagement by X%"
- "Reduced bug reports by X%"

### 3. **Add New Sections**

#### Certifications Section
```
CERTIFICATIONS
- [Any online courses from Udemy, Coursera, etc.]
- [AWS Certified, if you have it]
- [MongoDB Certification, if you have it]
```

#### Languages Section
```
LANGUAGES
- English: Professional Working Proficiency
- [Add any other languages]
```

### 4. **Optimize Keywords Density**

Add these keywords naturally throughout your resume:

**High Priority:**
- Full Stack Developer / Full Stack Engineer
- MERN Stack (you have this ✓)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) ✓
- Responsive Web Design ✓
- RESTful API / REST API ✓
- Microservices Architecture
- Version Control / Git ✓

**Medium Priority:**
- Code Review
- Documentation
- Cross-functional Team
- Scalable Applications ✓
- Performance Optimization ✓
- Web Application Security
- Authentication & Authorization ✓

### 5. **Update Project Descriptions**

Add action verbs and technical details:

**Strong Action Verbs:**
- Architected, Engineered, Implemented, Designed, Developed ✓
- Optimized, Enhanced, Integrated ✓
- Automated, Deployed, Migrated
- Collaborated ✓, Mentored, Led

**Example Update for Nexverce Project:**
```

- DevOps: Dockerized application and set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

Tech Stack: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Socket.IO, Cloudinary, OpenAI, Docker
```

### 6. **Enhance Summary Section**

Your summary is good, but could be more ATS-optimized:

#### Current Summary: (Good)
